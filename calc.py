# x = input("what is x? ")
# y = input("what is y? ")
# z = x + y will treat the numbers as strings and perform concatination output of z will be 12
#you should transform it to integers like this int(x) will be converted to string
# z = int(x) + int(y)
# print(z)
# another way to convert string to integer
x = int(input("what is x? "))
y = int(input("what is y? "))
z = (x) + (y)
